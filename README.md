Angular testing techtalk
========================

Very simple testing with karma and protractor.

This sample app is based on Julie's [protractor-demo](https://github.com/juliemr/protractor-demo)

Get the code and install the dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/andresdominguez/testing-tech-talk.git
$ cd testing-tech-talk
$ npm install
```

Run the unit tests:

```sh
$ ./node_modules/.bin/karma start
```
